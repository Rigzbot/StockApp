NetworkBoundResource for getting database values

avoid Transformations.map() as it works on main thread

use Flow instead of liveData when getting list of values from database

viewDataBinding.root gives context in adapter

use init block in onCreateViewHolder and then set viewDataBinding.shareButton.setOnClickListener { }

make sure onBindViewHolder is clear and does not have much logic

Use binding in ViewHolder class to reuse code

Use Response instead of Deferred and make function suspend when getting data from API
